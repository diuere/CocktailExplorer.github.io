# type of the project
This is a test project created with the purpose of demonstrating some of my abilities.
The majority of the design was based on tutorials designs created by John Smilga from freecodecamp.

# warm
As this project was created based on multiple designs, I intentionally didn't consider further the matter of future maintenance and escalation. Therefore, many fixed values were used on the style properties. Also, the gaps between sections wasn't properly distributed as that side of the design wasn't really the point of the project.
